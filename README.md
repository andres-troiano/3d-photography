# 3D profilometry using laser triangulation

## Abstract

A 3D laser triangulation profilometry system consisting of two camera-laser pairs was calibrated. The visible field was scanned with a reference object used for the sizing of industrial products, in order to relate the points in the camera coordinate system with their corresponding ones in space. 3 variants of this method were studied, using different reference objects: a trapezoidal pattern, a hexagonal pattern, and an original design featuring 90 corners. These 3 variants were put to the test by measuring 3 cylindrical standards with diameters ranging from 140 mm to 177 mm, obtaining in all cases errors that did not exceed 135 Î¼m. Two of the methods used are extensible to 6 camera-laser pairs.
